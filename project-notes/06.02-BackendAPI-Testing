📁 Project Notes: Backend API Testing

✅ Overview:

In this phase of the Expense Tracker project, we have successfully completed the entire backend setup including authentication, JWT protection, and full CRUD operations for user-specific expenses. All endpoints were tested using Thunder Client inside VS Code.

✅ API Endpoints Tested

    1. GET All Expenses

        URL: GET http://localhost:5000/api/expenses

        Headers: Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>

        Expected Result:

        Returns an empty array [] if no expenses exist.

        Returns a list of the logged-in user's expenses.

    2. POST New Expense

    URL: POST http://localhost:5000/api/expenses

    Headers: Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>

    Body (JSON):
        {
        "title": "Groceries",
        "amount": 80,
        "category": "Food",
        "date": "2025-05-13"
        }

    Expected Result: Returns the created expense object with a unique ID.

    3. PUT Update Expense

    URL: PUT http://localhost:5000/api/expenses/:id

    Headers: Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>

    Body (JSON):
        {
        "title": "Updated Groceries",
        "amount": 100
        }

    Expected Result: Returns the updated expense object.

    4. DELETE Expense

    URL: DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/expenses/:id

    Headers: Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>

    Expected Result:

    { "message": "Deleted" }




🧪 Reminder for Testing (If Retesting Needed)

Restart server:

Run node index.js or npm run dev after changes.

Use token in Authorization header:

Format: Bearer your-jwt-token

Use correct JSON body structure in POST/PUT.

Make sure express.json() is added in index.js.

    Step

    Description

    Status

    JWT Middleware

    Validates JWT tokens in /middlewares/authMiddleware.js

    ✅ Done

    ExpenseController CRUD

    Full Add/Edit/Delete logic with Sequelize

    ✅ Done

    User–Expense Connection

    Foreign key (UserId) links expense to correct user

✅ What’s Next?
Now that:

Your auth works

Token is saved and passed

Expense routes are tested and linked to logged-in user

👉 You’re officially ready for Frontend Development (React.js)! 🎉

## ✅ NEXT PHASE: FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION (React.js)

### Here’s What We’ll Build:

1. 🛡️ **Authentication**

   * Register / Login forms (with validation)
   * Store JWT in `localStorage`
   * Protect dashboard route

2. 💵 **Expense Dashboard**

   * View all expenses
   * Add/Edit/Delete
   * Filter by category/date

3. 📊 **Visual Dashboard**

   * Pie Chart (category breakdown)
   * Bar Chart (monthly spending)

4. 🎨 UI/UX

   * Clean, responsive UI (using basic CSS or a framework like Tailwind/Bootstrap if you like)
