🔧 PHASE 2: COMPLETE THE BACKEND (Expenses APIs)
Before we touch frontend, we finish all backend functionality:

🔐 Authentication middleware (to protect expense routes using the JWT token)

🧾 Expense APIs:

GET /api/expenses – get all for the logged-in user

POST /api/expenses – add an expense

PUT /api/expenses/:id – edit expense

DELETE /api/expenses/:id – delete expense

🔐 All of the above should work only if the user is logged in (authenticated with token)

🧠 Why Finish Backend First?
Because it allows us to:

✅ Test all APIs fully in Thunder Client/Postman

✅ Make sure they work correctly and securely

✅ Then build frontend cleanly, using actual API data

So yes — we follow this exact structure:

📋 PLAN FOR REMAINING BACKEND (BEFORE FRONTEND)
Step	Description	                                                            Status
1.	Create auth middleware to validate JWT	                                    🔜 Next
2.	Add ExpenseController with full CRUD	                                    🔜
3.	Setup routes/expenses.js and test in Thunder Client	                        🔜
4.	Connect user to each expense (foreign key)	                                ✅ Already in model
5.	Protect routes with token	                                                🔜
6.	✅ THEN move to frontend	                                                  ⏭️ After all above

✅ So, Let's Proceed with Step 1: Auth Middleware

Once we do that, we’ll implement expense routes and test them before jumping to React.
